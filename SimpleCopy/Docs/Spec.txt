The application should allow the user to pick or type a source folder and a target folder to which the source directory should be copied. 
The source folder should be copied inside the target folder (which has to already exist – although it should not already contain 
the source directory – e.g. in the case somebody “repeats” the copy).

Directories should be explicitly created prior to copying the files into them.

Use System.IO.Directory.GetFiles to retrieve a list of files in a given directory
Use System.IO.Directory.GetDirectories to retrieve a list of subdirectories for a given directory
Use System.IO.File.Copy to copy a given file
Use System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory to create directories prior to copying files into them
During the copying procedure the application should show a history of each of the copied files using a simple Listbox control, 
which visually updates as the copy is being performed. DO NOT attempt to write a background worker / multithreaded application unless you really
 want to. Application.DoEvents() is perfectly acceptable.

TIP: You should ensure that the folder you are copying from has plenty of files (at least 100),  multiple folders and sub folders. 
Some of the files should be at least 5MB so you can see how the application performs under these conditions.

ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS:-

Implement a recursive technique to copy each file from the source directory to the target directory.
Write the application in a way that the "copying" functionality can be reused - for example in a web application. 
That means you must de-couple your business logic and UI
